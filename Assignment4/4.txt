d) List any 3 ways which helps us in improving the accessibility of HTML.

1. Assign alt tags for images
Images on a webpage provide great value to users. Nonetheless, they can create barriers for users with limited or 
impaired vision. Therefore, assigning alt tags to images will provide a description of the images allowing users 
to understand the image through the use of a screen reader. Alt tags also contribute to a higher SEO score on 
Google.

2. Use colors carefully
Colors can help your users easily distinguish different sets of information. However, color blindness and other 
disabilities can make it difficult for users to find information, call-to-action buttons, or other aspects when 
developers fail to maintain a proper contrast of colors.

3. Turn dynamic content into accessible content
When embedding videos or gifs into your website, it is important to provide closed captions and text alternatives 
for users with hearing or visual impairments. Additionally, use ARIA properties when content on a webpage is added 
or updated without having to refresh the page, which will ensure that screen readers become aware of the new content.
