        <h1>Features of HTML5</h1>
        <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the standard markup language for creating web pages 
            and web applications. HTML5 is the 5th version of HTML. With invent of features in HTML5, it’s not only 
            possible to create better websites, but we can also create dynamic websites.
        </p>
        <p> The new features that were added in HTML5 that make it better than HTML :</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Intro of audio and video:</b>
                <p> Audio and Video tags are the two major addition to HTML5. It allows developers to embed a video 
                    or audio on their website. HTML5 video can use CSS and CSS3 to style the video tag. You can 
                    change the border, opacity, reflections, gradients, transitions, transformations, and even 
                    animations. HTML5 makes adding video super-fast and without having to build a video player. 
                    This saves time for the developer and offers the client a superior and more affordable solution.
                </p>
                <b>Example of video and audio tag:</b> 
                <br><br>
                <audio src="./2021-12-14_-_Space_Adventure_Intro_-_David_Fesliyan.mp3" controls>Audio</audio>
                <br><br>
                <video src="./file_example_MP4_480_1_5MG.mp4" controls></video> <br> <br>
            </li>
            <li><b>Placeholder Attribute:</b>
                <p>The placeholder attribute specifies a short hint that describes the expected value of an input 
                    field/text area. The short hint is displayed in the field before the user enters a value.
                </p>
                <b>Example:</b> <br><br>
                <form action=" ">  
                    <input type="text" name="fname" placeholder="First name"> <br>  
                    <input type="text" name="lname" placeholder="Last name"> <br>  
                    <input type="submit" value="Submit">  
                </form>  <br>
            </li>
            <li><b>Header and Footer:</b>
                <p>
                    With these new tags, there is no longer a need to identify the two elements with a <b><i>div</i></b> tag. 
                    Footer is placed at the end of the web page while Header is placed at the start of the web page. 
                    By using <b><i>'header and footer'</i></b> HTML5 elements, the browser will know what to load first and what 
                    to load later.<br> 
                    The header can contain-
                    <ul type="disc">
                        <li>One or more heading elements (h1 – h6) </li>
                        <li>Logo or icon</li>
                        <li>Authorship information</li>
                    </ul>
                    Footer can contain-
                    <ul type="disc">
                        <li>Authorship information</li>
                        <li>Copyright information</li>
                        <li>Contact information</li>
                        <li>Back to top links</li>
                    </ul>
                    They both have the same default CSS property as a display block.
                </p>
                <b>Example of Header:</b> <br><br>

                <header>  
                    <h1>This is the heading.</h1>  
                    <h4>This is the sub-heading.</h4>  
                        <p>This is the metadata.</p> 
                </header>  <br>
                <b>Example of Footer:</b> <br><br>
                <footer>  
                    <nav>  
                        <p><a href="#">About Us</a>|  
                            <a href="#">Privacy Policy</a>|  
                            <a href="#">Careers</a>  
                        </p> 
                    </nav>  
                    <p>Some rights reserved</p>
                </footer>
            </li>
            <li><b>Nav tag:</b>
            <p>
                The <b><em>nav</em></b> tag defines a set of navigation links. It is used for the part of an internet site that 
                    links to different pages at the website. The hyperlinks can be organized through a number of 
                    approaches. Common examples of the nav elements are menus, tables, contents, and indexes. This 
                    element makes it much easier to create a navigation menu, creates a neat horizontal menu of text 
                    links, and helps screen reading software to correctly identify primary navigation areas in the 
                    document.
            </p>
            <b>Example of Footer:</b> <br><br>
            <h3> HTML Nav tag</h3> 
            <nav> 
                <a href="#">HTML</a> 
                <a href="#">CSS</a> 
                <a href="#">JavaScript</a> 
                <a href="#">jQuery</a> 
            </nav><br><br>
            </li> 
            <li><b>Vector Graphics:</b>
                <p>
                    This is a new addition to the revised version which has hugely impacted the use of Adobe Flash 
                    in websites. It can be used to draw graphics with various shapes and colors via scripting usually 
                    JS. Vector graphics are scalable, easy to create and edit. It also supports interactivity and 
                    animation. Having a smaller file size makes transferring and loading graphics much faster on the 
                    web. That’s the reason why many people prefer to use vector graphics.
                </p>
                <b>Example:</b> <br><br>
                <svg id = "svgelem" height = "200" xmlns = "http://www.abc.org/2000/svg"> 
                    <circle id = "circle" cx = "50" cy = "50" r = "50" fill = "brown" /> 
               </svg> 
            </li>
