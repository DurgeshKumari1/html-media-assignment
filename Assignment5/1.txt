1. What is SEO and explain the importance of SEO?

- Search engine optimization (SEO) is the practice of optimizing a website's content, structure, and overall online 
presence to improve its visibility and ranking in search engine results pages (SERPs). 
- It involves techniques like keyword research, on-page optimization, link building, and technical SEO 
(more on those later) to make the website appealing to both search engines and users. 
- Businesses engage in SEO to get found and capture demand. Which can increase website traffic, drive conversions, 
and increase sales. 

Importance of SEO -

a) Enhance User Experience (UX)
SEO is not only about search engines but good SEO practices improve the user experience and usability of a website.

b) Build Credibility With Users
Users trust search engines, and having a presence in the top positions for the keywords the user is searching 
increases the website’s trust.

c) Rankings and visibility
When searching for something online, users are most likely to interact with the top 10 Google results. Proper SEO 
helps you rank on the first page (top 10 results) for the relevant keywords. This allows you to gain more organic 
visibility, puts you right in front of potential customers, and enhances the chance of users clicking and exploring 
your site.

d) Increased web traffic
Getting site visitors through paid ads may be a good strategy, but it’s not feasible in the long run. If potential 
users can’t find your website, your sales opportunities will decline significantly. SEO, when done right, increases 
the organic traffic for your website and attracts new and relevant users. The beauty of organic traffic is it brings 
in users on the merit of your website and content’s quality. This helps you rank on the first page and establishes 
credibility in your site, which increases your chances of sales and profitability.
