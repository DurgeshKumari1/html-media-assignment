3. What are the benefits of using meta tags?

There are several benefits to using meta tags on a web page:

a) Improved Search Engine Optimization (SEO): 
Meta tags can provide important information to search engines about the content of a web page, which can improve 
its visibility in search results.

b) Better User Experience: Meta tags, particularly the meta description tag, can provide a brief summary of the 
content on a web page, which can help users quickly determine whether the page is relevant to their needs.

c) More Accurate Search Results: When search engines have a better understanding of the content of a web page, 
they can provide more accurate search results to users.

d) Improved Click-Through Rates: A well-written meta description tag can entice users to click on a search result, 
which can improve click-through rates and drive more traffic to a website.

e) Enhanced Accessibility: Meta tags can be used to provide information about a web page's accessibility features, 
such as whether it has been optimized for mobile devices or is accessible to people with disabilities.

Overall, using meta tags on a web page can help improve its visibility in search results, provide a better user 
experience, and drive more traffic to a website. However, it's important to use meta tags correctly and in 
conjunction with other SEO strategies to achieve the best results.
