2. Purpose of Comments in HTML with example of how to use comments in HTML - 

HTML comments are annotations or notes added in an HTML code that are not displayed by the browser. 
Just like comments in other languages HTML comments also serve the same purpose of providing code explanations, 
reminders, or instructions for developers who are collaborating on the same project.

HTML comments are not displayed on browsers while rendering the page making them useful to add additional 
information without affecting the appearance of the webpage. You can use the HTML comment tag(<!--Comment tag-->) 
to comment in the html code.

Example:

<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset ="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" initial-scale="1.0">
    <title>HTML Comments</title>
</head>
<body> 
    <!--This is heading Tag-->
    <h1>Comments in HTML</h1>
    <!--This is single line comment-->
    <p>There are single line &
    multi line comments in HTML</p>

    <!-- This defines the 
    multi line comments
    in HTML-->
</body> 
</html>
