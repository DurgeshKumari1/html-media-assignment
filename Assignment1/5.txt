5. DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML

A DOCTYPE or document type declaration is an instruction that tells the web browser about the markup language in 
which the current page is written. The DOCTYPE is not an element or tag, it lets the browser know about the version 
of or standard of HTML or any other markup language that is being used in the document.

A DOCTYPE declaration appears at the top of a web page before all other elements. According to the HTML specification 
or standards, every HTML document requires a document type declaration to ensure that the pages are displayed in the 
way they are intended to be displayed.

The DOCTYPE for HTML5 is case-insensitive and can be written as shown below:

<!DOCTYPE html>
