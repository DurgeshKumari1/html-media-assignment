        <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
        <!-- This is the paragraph tag used to define the paragraph-->
        <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and design web pages 
            on the internet. It was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 at CERN as a simple markup language. 
            Since then, it has evolved through versions from HTML 2.0 to HTML5 (the latest 2024 version).
            <br>HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the 
            web pages and Markup language defines the text document within the tag.
        </p>
        <!--In above paragraph br tag is used for line break, which is to break the paragraph from there & 
            start the content of the same paragraph from the new line -->

        <h2>HTML Elements and Tags</h2>
        <p>HTML uses predefined tags and elements that tell the browser how to display the content. HTML elements include 
            an opening tag, some content, and a closing tag.
            <br>Remember to include closing tags. If omitted, the browser applies the effect of the opening tag until the 
            end of the page.</p>
