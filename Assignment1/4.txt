4. Short Note on tag & element with example.

HTML Tags and Elements are sometimes perceived as the same. However, they are not. There is a subtle difference 
between HTML elements and tags.

Tags: HTML Tags are building blocks of HTML Page. They tell the browser how it should display content to the user. 
A tag starts with a < bracket and ends with a > bracket. Most tags exist in pairs in HTML. Tags have an opening and 
closing part. They are similar, except the closing part has a / sign after the opening bracket.

Example of tag:

<h1>This is heading tag.</h1>

In this <h1> is opening tag & </h1> is closing tag.

Elements: HTML Element includes a start tag, content, and an end tag. HTML Elements are components of the web page. 
Let's say we created a div block and filled it with some text. Then the text-filled div becomes the component of 
the HTML Page. The <div></div> tags along with the content inside it becomes a component and HTML Element. 
This will be rendered and shown to the user.

Example of Element:

<p>This is a paragraph tag.</tag>

Here, <p> is the start tag, </p> is the end tag & 'This is a paragraph tag' is the content within the paragraph element.
