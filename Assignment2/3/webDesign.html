            <h1>Web Design</h1>
            <p>Web design refers to the design of websites. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of 
                website development rather than software development. Web design used to be focused on designing 
                websites for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers 
                has become ever-increasingly important.

                A web designer works on a website's appearance, layout, and, in some cases, content.<br>
                <b>Appearance</b> relates to the colors, typography, and images used.<br>
                <b>Layout</b> refers to how information is structured and categorized. A good web design is easy 
                to use, aesthetically pleasing, and suits the user group and brand of the website.<br><br>

                A well-designed website is simple and communicates clearly to avoid confusing users. It wins and 
                fosters the target audience's trust, removing as many potential points of user frustration as 
                possible.<br>
                Responsive and adaptive design are two common ways to design websites that work well on both 
                desktop and mobile.
