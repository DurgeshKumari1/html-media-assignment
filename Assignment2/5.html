            <dd>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design the front end portion of web pages 
                using markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines 
                the link between the web pages. The markup language is used to define the text documentation within 
                tag which defines the structure of web pages.

                Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify 
                the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More 
                importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.

                Node.js is an open source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code 
                outside of a browser. You need to remember that NodeJS is not a framework and it’s not a programming 
                language. Most of the people are confused and understand it’s a framework or a programming language. 
                We often use Node.js for building back-end services like APIs like Web App or Mobile App. It’s used 
                in production by large companies such as Paypal, Uber, Netflix, Walmart and so on.
